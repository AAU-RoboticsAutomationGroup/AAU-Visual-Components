# Visual Components Models and Code
This repository contains the source code and models used for Visual Components demonstrators related to the Industrial Metaverse. 
The demonstrators revolve around the AAU 5G Smart Production Lab and consist of x demonstrators:
1. **Stand-alone simulation** (Layouts/Smart_Lab_Final_w_Robot)
2. **Simulation controlled by PLC using OPC UA** (Layouts/Smart_Lab_Final_w_Robot_PLC)
3. **Two VC instances connected with MQTT and Omniverse** (Layouts/MQTT/Smart_Lab_Final_Part_1 & Smart_Lab_Final_Part_2)
4. **Simulation controlled by MES4** (Layouts/MES4/Smart_Lab_Final_w_MES)
5. **Simulation connected with PLC and MES4** (Layouts/MES4/Smart_Lab_Final_w_MES_PLC)

>[!NOTE]
>The models have been developed and tested in Visual Components version 4.10.1. It is known that the models do not work in 4.10.2 but might be fixable rebuilding by changing conveyor routing configuration.
